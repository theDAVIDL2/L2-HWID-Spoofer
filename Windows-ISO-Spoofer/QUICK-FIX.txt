========================================
QUICK FIX - Get Spoofer Working Now
========================================

You're getting "Security Violation" because
Secure Boot is blocking unsigned code.

========================================
EASIEST FIX (5 minutes):
========================================

1. Restart computer
2. Enter BIOS (press F2, Del, F12, or ESC during boot)
3. Find "Secure Boot" setting
   (Usually in: Security tab, Boot tab, or Advanced)
4. DISABLE Secure Boot
5. Save and Exit (usually F10)
6. Boot Windows normally
7. Run: START-HERE.bat (as admin)
8. Click: "4. Install to System"
9. Restart
10. Select "L2signed" at boot
11. DONE - Spoofer works!

========================================
WHY THIS WORKS:
========================================

- Secure Boot checks digital signatures
- Your spoofer is signed with YOUR certificate
- Windows doesn't trust your certificate (yet)
- Disabling Secure Boot = no signature check
- Spoofer runs perfectly

========================================
IS THIS SAFE?
========================================

YES - Disabling Secure Boot for this purpose:
- Does NOT harm your system
- Does NOT make you vulnerable (if you're careful)
- Is commonly done for custom bootloaders
- Your spoofer works identically either way

========================================
IF YOU WANT SECURE BOOT ON:
========================================

See: MOK-ENROLLMENT-MANUAL.md
(More complex, but keeps Secure Boot enabled)

========================================
RECOMMENDED FOR NOW:
========================================

Disable Secure Boot and get spoofer working.
You can always re-enable Secure Boot later
and do MOK enrollment if needed.
